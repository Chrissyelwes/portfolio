    <h3 class="test-class">About me</h3>   
    <p>I am an ex-graphic designer who is wanting to change career to coding. </p>
    <p>I was introduced to coding when I was 16. We created our own websites using html and enjoyed it but thought Computer Science is very tough (plus I thought it's mostly men and I didn't want to feel left out) and I would need to be good at maths to do it. 
    So I went to study Computer Graphics instead. I became a graphic designer but did not like it.
    </p>
    <p>Last year, I found out one of our
        family friend in my upholstery class used to be a programmer. I was immediately inspired and interested in coding again.
        She is now helping children how to code through Code Club. So I asked her if I can help and she said yes! I then decided to take up coding as my next career and looked for courses online. Also got into coding partly because jobs can be done remotely as I live in a village and prefer to stay.</p>

                Cosplayed as a Viking I designed last Halloween. I am into gaming and discovered my love for crafting clothes and weapons since I was a teen.
